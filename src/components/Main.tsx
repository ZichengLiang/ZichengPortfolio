          Welcome to my website, here I&#39;m not trying to impress with flashy stacks or big claims. Instead, I want this space to reflect how I think, how I work, and how I learn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Much of what I share here begins with a question or a moment of friction—and takes shape through isolating problems, testing ideas, and learning from the missteps along the way.
        </p>

          For example, you&#39;ll find how I approached building an agentic music generation workflow — what worked, what didn&#39;t, and how I refined it over time. Or how I designed MiaoNance, a smart notebook that weaves together personal research and live crypto market data, inspired by the needs of investors like my mother.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
         My hope is that, as you explore this site, you will get a sense of how I work—with care, adaptability, and a steady sense of ownership over the things I build.
