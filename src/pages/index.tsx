                        I didnâ€™t begin in computer scienceâ€”I started in history, drawn by questions more than answers. When I first learned to code, it felt like solving puzzles: make things faster, more efficient. I trained for algorithm competitions and chased performance. But through real-world projects, Iâ€™ve been learning that the best code doesnâ€™t just run fastâ€”it listens, adapts, and serves the people.
                        <br />
                        Curiosity is what drives me. I like understanding how things work under the hoodâ€”breaking down problems, spotting patterns, finding the structure beneath the mess. In an AI music project, that meant diving into both agentic workflows and the patterns in music theory. In a crypto tool I built for my mom, it meant designing a system that translated complex data into something accurate and intuitive.
                        <br />
                        At Trinity College Dublin, where I study Computer Science, Iâ€™ve worked across the stackâ€”from assembly and system architecture to full-stack deployment. But what I value most isnâ€™t any single technology. Itâ€™s the habit of thinking rigorously, listening deeply, and building thoughtfully. I often come back to Vitruviusâ€™s triadâ€”firmitas (robustness), utilitas (functionality), and venustas (beauty)â€”and how it still shapes what good design can be.
                        <br />
                        As Iâ€™ve grown, Iâ€™ve met many brilliant minds, and I know Iâ€™m not always the brightest in the room. Thereâ€™s still so much I donâ€™t know. But I take pride in being reflective, analytical, and curious. I care about the why as much as the how, and Iâ€™m always learning how to build with more clarity, purpose, and care.
